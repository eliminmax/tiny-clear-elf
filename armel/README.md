## Breakdown

The file has 4 parts to it - the ELF header, the Program Header table, the code, and the data.

Given that this is a 32-bit ELF file, the ELF header is 52 bytes, and one entry in the Program Header table is 32 bytes long. The string to print is 6 bytes long.

### Disassembly

```asm
# ELF ehdr
  # e_ident
    # EI_MAG0, EI_MAG1, EI_MAG2, EI_MAG3: ELFMAG0, ELFMAG1, ELFMAG2, ELFMAG3 - the ELF magic number
    .ascii "\177ELF"
    # EI_CLASS: 1 is ELFCLASS32 - meaning it's a 32-bit object
    .byte 0x1
    # EI_DATA: 1 is ELFDATA2LSB - meaning that values are little-endian encoded
    .byte 0x1
    # EI_VERSION: 1 is EV_CURRENT - the only valid value
    .byte 0x1
    # EI_OSABI: 0 is ELFOSABI_NONE - the generic SYSV ABI
    .byte 0x0
    # EI_ABIVERSION: used to distinguish between incompatible ABI versions. Unused for the SYSV ABI
    .byte 0x0
    # The remaining 7 bytes are unused, and should be set to 0

    .2byte 0x28
  # e_version
    # EV_CURRENT - the only valid value
    .4byte 0x1
  # e_entry
    # The virtual memory to transfer control at. The file is loaded into memory address 0x20000, and the code starts 0x54 bytes into the file. Adding 1 starts it in thumb mode.
    .4byte 0x20055
  # e_phoff
    # the offset from the beginning of the file to the program header table
    .4byte 0x34
  # e_shoff
    # the offset from the beginning of the file to the section header table - zero, as there is no section header table
    .4byte 0x0
  # e_flags
    # processor-specific flags. Specify that the latest version of the ABI is in use
    .4byte 0x05000000
  # e_ehsize
    # the size (in bytes) of the ELF header. for a 32-bit ELF, this will always be 52
    .2byte 0x34
  # e_phentsize
    # the size (in bytes) of an entry in the program header table.
    .2byte 0x20
  # e_phnum
    # the number of entries in the program header table
    .2byte 0x1
  # e_shentsize
    # the size of an entry in the section header table, or 0 if there is no section header table
    .2byte 0x0
  # e_shnum
    # the number of entries in the section header table
    .2byte 0x0

# Program Header Table
  # Program header entry
    # p_type - PT_LOAD (1) - a loadable program segment
    .4byte 0x1
    # p_offset - offset (in bytes) of start of segment in file

    .4byte 0x020000
    # p_paddr - load this segment from physical address 0 in file
    .4byte 0x0

    .4byte 0x6a
    # p_memsz - size (in bytes) of memory to load the segment into
    .4byte 0x6a
    # p_flags - segment permissions - PF_X + PF_R (0x1 + 0x100) - readable and executable
    .4byte 0x5
    # p_align - segment alignment - segment addresses must be aligned to multiples of this value
    .4byte 0x2

# The actual code
  # first syscall: write(1, 0x20078, 6)
    # On 32-bit arm systems, write is syscall 4.
    mov r7, #0x4
    # STDOUT is file descriptor #1
    mov r0, #0x1
    # instead of taking 12 bytes to use a mov to set the lower
    # bytes followed by a movt to set the upper bytes, set them relative to the program counter
    adr r1, ESCAPE_SEQ
    # this adds the value in the program counter register (the current memory address) to the provided value.
    # There are 8 bytes between this instruction and the the data to print.
    # Write 6 bytes of data
    mov r2, #0x6
    # supervisor call 0 is equivalent to amd64's syscall and i386's int 0x80
    svc 0x0
  # Second syscall: exit(0)
    # on 32-bit arm systems, exit is syscall 1.
    mov r7, #0x1
    # error code 0 - no error
    mov r0, #0x0
    # supervisor call 0
    svc 0x0

# I'd normally not use any labels in these, but the ADR encoding used requires a label
#   so that the assembler can calculate the offset the distance from the adr instruction to the label
#   I'd prefer to just input an immediate (i.e. adr r1, #0x8) but that's invalid syntax
ESCAPE_SEQ:
# The escape sequences
  .ascii "\33c\33[3J"
```

#### Reassembly

To re-assemble the disassembly, you need to first assemble it with a 32-bit ARM version of the GNU assembler (`gas`, or just `as`) and linker (`ld`), as well as `objcopy`. All of these are part of GNU binutils. The problem is that it adds its own ELF header, program, and section tables, so you then need to extract the actual file out from its output.

I used the versions from Debian Bookworm's `binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi` package.

On `armel` systems, one should instead use the `binutils` package, as the `binutils-armel-linux-gnu` package is meant for working with foreign binaries.

If you save the disassembly to `clear.S`, you'll need to do the following to reassemble it:

```sh
# On non-armel Debian systems with binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi installed, this will ensure
# the appropriate binutils versions are first in the PATH.
# On armel Debian systems, it's probably harmless.
PATH="/usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/bin:$PATH"

# assemble
as -mthumb -march=armv5t -o clear.o clear.S -no-pad-sections
# -mthumb instructs it to use Thumb instead of ARM instructions
# -march=armv5t ensures that the instructions are valid on all Debian armel systems

# link
ld -o clear.wrapped clear.o

# extract
objcopy -O binary clear.wrapped clear
```
