# for this script to work, the system SHOULD be able to run foreign ELF binaries as
# though they were native, using the Linux kernel's binfmt_misc capabilities and
# something like qemu-user, MUST be run from the Tiny Clear ELF git directory,
# and MUST have the following programs installed:
#
# * awk
# * cat
# * dirname
# * figlet
# * head
# * hexyl
# * rasm2
# * readelf
# * realpath
# * stty
# * tail
# * tput
#
# other than rasm2, those are provided by the following packages on Debian 12 (Bookworm):
#
# * awk (awk)
# * binutils (readelf)
# * coreutils (cat, dirname, head, realpath, stty, tail)
# * hexyl (hexyl)
# * figlet (figlet)
# * ncurses-bin (tput)
#
# awk is a virtual package provided by gawk, mawk, or original-awk.
# The one awk command used here has been tested with all three
#
# rasm2 is part of the radare2 reverse engineering toolkit, which is not in
# Debian's repos. Its source can be found at https://github.com/radareorg/radare2
# 
# On a Debian system, to run foreign binaries as though they're native, you SHOULD install:
# * systemd or binfmt-support (enables binfmt_misc usage and provides an interface to it)
# * qemu-user-binfmt or qemu-user-static (enables running foreign binaries)
#
# If you do not have bindmt_misc enabled, or do not want to use it, define the FORCE_USE_QEMU
# environment variable, and this will try to fall back to invoking qemu-user binaries.
# Will prioritize qemu-$arch over qemu-$arch-static, but supports the latter as a fall-back
# If you do that, then each supported architecture MUST have qemu-$arch and/or qemu-$arch-static
# installed to the $PATH.
#
# This script MUST be run in a terminal emulator that's at least 94 columns and 50 rows in size.
# To avoid cutting off content, if it detects that it's not operating at that size, it will exit.
#
# Exit code 2 means that there was an issue with the terminal environment (e.g. too small to fit the presentation).
# Exit code 3 means that there was a dependency issue
# Exit code 100 means that something is seriously broken, and `cd`ing to the directory containing this script failed.
